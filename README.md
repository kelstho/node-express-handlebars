# Eat the Burger
This SQL based application allows the user to create a "burger" to devour, then allows them to devour it. Once it has been devoured, the user then has the option to throw it up and eat it again if they so choose.

The starting screen greets the user with two lists of burgers. The left list contains burgers that are ready to be devoured, while the right list contains burgers that have already been devoured and are now ready to be thrown up. Clicking the 'devour it' button on any of the burgers in the left list will move that burger over to the right list, and the button will change to 'throw it up.' Clicking this button will move the selected burger back over to the left side, and the button will once again change to 'devour it.'
